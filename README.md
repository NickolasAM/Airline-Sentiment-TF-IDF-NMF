# Airline Sentiment Analytics

Python NLP project that analyzes airline customer tweets and identifies recurring themes using TF-IDF and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

Developed for CS356: Foundations of Big Data Analytics.

## Overview

The application processes 14,640 airline-related tweets, transforms unstructured text into numerical TF-IDF features, and applies NMF topic modeling to identify common themes.

Each tweet is assigned a dominant theme, and the analyzed dataset is exported to a new CSV file.
